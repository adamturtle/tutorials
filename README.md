# Tutorials not taking anything for granted

I've always hated tutorials, suggestions, answers taking a whole world of knowledge for granted. Unfortunately, the usual pattern is:

1. read the official documentation
1. swear because one crucial detail is taken for granted ***[ frustration.start() ]***
1. Google, Google, Google... ***[ frustration.increase() ]***
1. find the crucial detail explicitly described on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) ***[ frustration.stop() ]***
1. continue reading the official documentation ***[ frustration.readyToStart() ]***
1. ...

I've had enough of this: by these tutorials, I wish to provide readers easy practical steps to achieve some results I've struggled for hours and hours.

I'm human, of course, and I'm sure I'll take something for granted without realizing, also within these tutorials: feel free to suggest, fork, send pull requests and report issues.

Enjoy!
